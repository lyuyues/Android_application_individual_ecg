The development of mobile devices technology and the Internet, making smart-phone
a very feasible platform for mobile health applications for the management of dier-
ent chronic diseases, have the potential to improve health outcomes. One of these
is the smart-phone ECG technology. Previously, obtaining an ECG has involved a
bulky machine requiring medical training to operate. Now, most of the smart-phone
ECG technologies involve a single-lead ECG but not precise enough and passively
detection.

HC provides a 2-lead ECG obtained from a small sensor that wirelessly com-
municates with an Android smart-phone. It is capable of monitoring arrhythmias and
heart rate to match the increasing demand for screening, diagnosis, and monitoring
of rhythm disorders. The implementation of HeartCarer runs on an Android smart-
phone and has two version: clinical and individual. The clinical version is associated
with medical processes while the individual version is for costumers easy to use on
their own sake.
